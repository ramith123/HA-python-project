# HA-python-project

This is a personal project that uses the [Home Assistant api]( https://www.home-assistant.io/) and a little bit of python to create a custom CLI to control lights, ac etc...

not really useful out of the box but someone could find a use for it..

the `.CustomHA` folder should be located in your home folder (Documents on windows) and the `secret.json` should has a token and the url of your HA

names of the lights and ac can be changed from `data.json` file
